# Salon

The application ["Salon"](https://salon-w3cpovaqka-de.a.run.app) provides the ability to publish and advertise the services of beauty salon owners on the web.

## Overview

The services to be advertised are defined and published in section ["Services"](https://salon-w3cpovaqka-de.a.run.app/admin/services) of group "Data". Optionally, services can be defined as a hierarchy of groups and subservices.

Each service can have multiple offers with corresponding prices and currencies. Offers are defined for each Service in the “Services” section in the “Data” group.

Once the service and its offerings are defined, the service can be published. The service and offers will be displayed to the customer in the section ["Services"](https://salon-w3cpovaqka-de.a.run.app/services) and available for booking in the section ["Book appointment"](https://salon-w3cpovaqka-de.a.run.app/book).
